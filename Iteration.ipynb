However, it's good to know about them, because you may want to implement your own classes (to be discussed later), such that instances of your class are iterable. Then you'll have to override the `__iter__()` method to return an iterator. A common way of doing this is to let `__iter__()` return the object itself, and implement the `__next__()` method. These methods are invoked when `iter()` and `next()` are called on the instances, and should not be invoked directly otherwise. "
